# Python Number Guessing Game (Hot / Cold) 🎯

This is a Python console-based number guessing game made for practice.
The computer randomly selects a number, and the player has to guess it.

After each guess, the game provides **Hot**, **Cold**, or **Right** hints based on how close
the guessed number is to the correct number.

The game also includes difficulty levels, attempt counting, and a replay option.
